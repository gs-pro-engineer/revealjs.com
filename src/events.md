# Events

We dispatch a number of events to make it easy for you to react to changes in the presentation. `Reveal.on()` is used to add event listeners, and `Reveal.off()` is used to remove them.

```js
Reveal.on( 'eventname', callbackFunction );
```

## Ready

The `ready` event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to accept API calls. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call `Reveal.isReady()`.

```javascript
Reveal.on( 'ready', event => {
  // event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
```

We also add a `.ready` class to the `.reveal` element so that you can hook into this with CSS.

The `Reveal.initialize` method also returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which resolves when the presentation is ready. The following is synonymous to adding a listener for the `ready` event:

```javascript
Reveal.initialize().then( () => {
  // reveal.js is ready
} )
```


## Slide Changed

The `slidechanged` event is fired each time the slide changes. The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML elements.

Some libraries, like MathJax (see [#226](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/226#issuecomment-10261609)), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.

```javascript
Reveal.on( 'slidechanged', event => {
  // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
```

## Slide Transition End

The `slidechanged` event fires instantly as soon as the slide changes. If you'd rather invoke your event listener when the slide has finished transitioning and is fully visible, you can use the `slidetransitionend` event. The `slidetransitionend` event includes the same event data as `slidechanged`.

```javascript
Reveal.on( 'slidetransitionend', event => {
	console.log( event.currentSlide );
});
```


## Resize

The `resize` event is fired when reveal.js changes the scale of the presentation.

```javascript
Reveal.on( 'resize', event => {
  // event.scale, event.oldScale, event.size
} );
```
