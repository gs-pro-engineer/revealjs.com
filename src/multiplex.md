# Multiplex

The multiplex plugin allows your audience to follow the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. When you change slides in your master presentations everyone will follow and see the same content on their own device.

This plugin was previously part of reveal.js core but as of 4.0.0 it has graduated to its own repository at <https://github.com/reveal/multiplex>.
