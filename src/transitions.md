# Transitions

When navigating a presentation, we transition between slides by animating them from right to left by default. This transition can be changed by setting the `transition` config option to a valid [transition style](#styles). Transitions can also be overridden for a specific slide using the `data-transition` attribute.

```html
<section data-transition="zoom">
  <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2>
</section>

<section data-transition-speed="fast">
  <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2>
</section>
```

## Styles

This is a complete list of all available transition styles. They work for both slides and slide backgrounds.

| Name     | Effect
| :-       | :-
| none     | Switch backgrounds instantly
| fade     | Cross fade — *default for background transitions*
| slide    | Slide between backgrounds — *default for slide transitions*
| convex   | Slide at a convex angle
| concave  | Slide at a concave angle
| zoom     | Scale the incoming slide up so it grows in from the center of the screen
{.key-value}

## Separate In-Out Transitions

You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide by appending `-in` or `-out` to the transition name.

```html
<section data-transition="slide">
    The train goes on …
</section>
<section data-transition="slide">
    and on …
</section>
<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out">
    and stops.
</section>
<section data-transition="fade-in slide-out">
    (Passengers entering and leaving)
</section>
<section data-transition="slide">
    And it starts again.
</section>
```
<div class="reveal reveal-example">
  <div class="slides">
    <section data-transition="slide">
        The train goes on …
    </section>
    <section data-transition="slide">
        and on …
    </section>
    <section data-transition="slide-in fade-out">
        and stops.
    </section>
    <section data-transition="fade-in slide-out">
        (Passengers entering and leaving)
    </section>
    <section data-transition="slide">
        And it starts again.
    </section>
  </div>
</div>

## Background Transitions

We transition between slide backgrounds using a cross fade by default. This can be changed on a global level or overridden for specific slides. To change background transitions for all slides, use the `backgroundTransition` config option.
```js
Reveal.initialize({
  backgroundTransition: 'slide'
});
```

Alternatively you can use the `data-background-transition` attribute on any `<section>` to override that specific transition.
