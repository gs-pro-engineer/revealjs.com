# Upgrading From Version 3 to 4.0
We make a strong effort to avoid breaking changes but there are a couple in version 4.0. If you want to migrate an existing presentation follow these instructions.

### Update Asset Locations
Our JS and CSS assets have moved. In your presentation HTML, update the following `<script>` and `<link>` paths:

| Old location                      | New location
| :-                                | :-
| js/reveal.js                      | dist/reveal.js
| css/reset.css                     | dist/reset.css
| css/reveal.css                    | dist/reveal.css
| css/theme/&lt;theme-name&gt;.css  | dist/theme/&lt;theme-name&gt;.css
| lib/css/monokai.css               | plugin/highlight/monokai.css
| lib/js/head.min.js  				| Deleted in 3.8.0
{.key-value}


### Remove Print CSS from `<head>`
In your presentation HTML, remove the following script from the `<head>`. These styles are now baked into the reveal.css file.

```html
<script>
  var link = document.createElement( 'link' );
  link.rel = 'stylesheet';
  link.type = 'text/css';
  link.href = window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ? 'css/print/pdf.css' : 'css/print/paper.css';
  document.getElementsByTagName( 'head' )[0].appendChild( link );
</script>
```

### Plugin Registration
If you keep a copy of the v3 /plugin directory there are *no breaking changes*. If you want to switch to the latest plugin versions, you'll need to update your `Reveal.initialize()` call to use the [new plugin registration syntax](/plugins/). Plugins are also available as ES modules.

```html
<script src="dist/reveal.js"></script>
<script src="plugin/markdown/markdown.js"></script>
<script src="plugin/highlight/highlight.js"></script>
<script>
  Reveal.initialize({
    plugins: [ RevealMarkdown, RevealHighlight ]
  });
</script>
```


### Removed Multiplex and Notes Server
The Multiplex and Notes Server plugins have moved out of reveal.js core to their own repositories. See their corresponding README's for usage instructions.
- https://github.com/reveal/multiplex
- https://github.com/reveal/notes-server

### Other
- Removed `Reveal.navigateTo`, use `Reveal.slide` instead.
- We've switched build systems to gulp & rollup. Make sure to `npm install` to get the latest dependencies. The server is still started with `npm start`, just like before.
