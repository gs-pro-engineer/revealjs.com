# Vertical Slides

Your slides are stepped between using a horizontal sliding transition by default. These horizontal slides are considered the main, or *top-level*, slides in your deck.

It's also possible to nest multiple slides within a single top-level slide to create a vertical stack. This is a great way to logically group content in your presentation and makes it convenient to include optional slides.

When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the top-level (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow. Here's an example showing a bird's-eye view of what this looks like in action.

## Markup

Here's what the markup looks like for a simple vertical stack.

```html
<section>Horizontal Slide</section>
<section>
  <section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
  <section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
</section>
```
<div class="reveal reveal-example">
  <div class="slides">
    <section>Horizontal Slide</section>
    <section>
      <section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
      <section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
    </section>
  </div>
</div>

## Navigation Mode
You can fine tune the reveal.js navigation behavior by using the `navigationMode` config option. Note that these options are only useful for presentations that use a mix of horizontal and vertical slides. The following navigation modes are available:

| Value                         | Description |
| :---------------------------  | :---------- |
| default                       | Left/right arrow keys step between horizontal slides. Up/down arrow keys step between vertical slides. Space key steps through all slides (both horizontal and vertical). |
| linear                        | Removes the up/down arrows. Left/right arrows step through all slides (both horizontal and vertical). |
| grid                          | When this is enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical index.<br><br>Consider a deck with six slides ordered in two vertical stacks:<br>`1.1`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`2.1`<br>`1.2`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`2.2`<br>`1.3`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`2.3`<br><br>If you're on slide 1.3 and navigate right, you will normally move from 1.3 -> 2.1. With navigationMode set to "grid" the same navigation takes you from 1.3 -> 2.3. |
